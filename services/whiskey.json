From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\n\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\nBeam Suntory",

Soft to the palate throughout, the next sip is always welcome. The mash is a mix of corn, rye, and malted barley. Akin to a “Vatted Malt,” no neutral grain spirit is added. We do not chill filter, a common practice that removes natural, flavor rich oils. Only a coarse particulate filter strains the small bits of charred oak surrendered by the barrel. Like many great whiskeys, this spirit has aged gently in ex-bourbon barrels. As much as we love the intense flavor of a bourbons, the abundant wood sugars in the new barrels required for their production mask many subtler, complex flavors. This spirit's patient aging in used cooperage yields a drier dram open to revealing these subtle essences of taste.",

This Speyside single malt Scotch whisky boasts a delicate balance of sweet summer fruits and spring flowers. You will also notice aromas of pineapple, pear, toasted cereal and honey, the latter of which shows up again on the finish.\n\nThe Glenlivet distilled in pots that still use 100 percent malted barley. It is then aged in traditional European and bourbon-seasoned American oak casks to bring forth the delectable flavors. Despite being produced in Scotland, The Glenlivet is the bestselling malt whisky in the United States. It is also the second-best single malt in the world, so you know you're buying the good stuff!\n\nNo other malt whisky has the legendary status enjoyed by The Glenlivet 12 Year. Its smooth character and tropical fruity notes make it a first-class malt, along with the mineral-rich spring water drawn from the distillery's historic well.\n\nSo, what does \"single malt\" mean, anyway? Single malt whisky is simply a malted whisky that has been made from a single distillery. As for the malted part, the whisky is made using malted grains as opposed to unmalted ones. According to Scotch Whisky Regulations, single malt Scotch whisky must be made with malted barley, distilled in a single distillery using pot stills and aged for at least three years. The Glenlivet, being a 12-year Scotch, is aged for 12. It's also a Speyside single malt Scotch, which means that it's produced in the River Spey region in northeastern Scotland.\n\nThe Glenlivet 12 Year is a vibrant gold hue with a summery nose. Since its palate is well balanced with forward tropical fruit notes, it's best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a little water added. At the finish, you'll savor a smooth creaminess with hints of fresh hazelnuts and marzipan.\n\nPair The Glenlivet with seafood dishes, such as seared scallops, to bring out the best characteristics in both. Even if you've never tasted a malt whisky before, The Glenlivet will make anyone a fan.\n\nBuy The Glenlivet 12 Year online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

The Limousin oak used is cut in France's Dordogne region, where it's often used to mature cognacs. Its low density allows whisky to sink deep into the wood, and The Glenlivet distillers carefully control how long the whisky matures in the casks so as not to overpower the desired result: a unique, pleasing spiciness.",

Not only is it named after the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln, it has some highly acclaimed brothers in the Jim Beam family: Booker's, Basil Hayden's and Baker's.\n\nAged nine years, Knob Creek is the oldest by a couple years. The extra aging draws more flavor and sugar from the wood, providing a full-bodied, fruity flavor with hints of grass and grain. It's 100-proof, which is considered the honest age of bourbons made a century ago. The Beam family makes this spirit with extra char on white oak barrels for a bigger flavor.\n\nKnob Creek Bourbon is comfortable on the top shelf of any home bar. You should put it right up there with the best names from Tennessee, Ireland, Canada or Scotland. It's a great dessert after a grilled steak and is at home with a cigar next to your ash tray.\n\nHow does it mix? Its bold, organic flavor stands up well in cocktails if you must mix it. Fresh mint and a hint of sugar make a fine Julep. It makes a nice old fashioned with orange, bitters and a cherry. The family suggests you try a new fashioned. Instead of sugar, use Amaretto as a sweetener. Mix that with bitters and an orange peel. Serve it up or on the rocks.\n\nWhatever you do, taste it with a little extra patience. It spent nine long years getting to you. Don't rush it.\n\nBuy Knob Creek Bourbon Whiskey online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Double Gold Medal at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition",

    "Description": "Ancient buffalo carved paths through the wilderness that led American pioneers and explorers to new frontiers. One such trail led to the banks of the Kentucky River where Buffalo Trace Distillery has been making bourbon whiskey the same way for more than 200 years. In tribute to the mighty buffalo and the rugged, independent spirit of the pioneers who followed them, we created our signature Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.\n\nBuffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is distilled, aged and bottled at the most award-winning distillery in the world. Made from the finest corn, rye and barley malt, this whiskey ages in new oak barrels for years in century old warehouses until the peak of maturity. The taste is rich and complex, with hints of vanilla, toffee and candied fruit. The smooth finish lingers on the palate. This will never change.\n\nTastingNotes\nThis deep amber whiskey has a complex aroma of vanilla, mint and molasses. Pleasantly sweet to the taste with notes of brown sugar and spice that give way to oak,  toffee, dark fruit and anise. This whiskey finishes long and smooth with serious depth.\n\nRATINGS\nWine Enthusiast rating: 93 \n\nREVIEWS\n\"One of the world's great whiskeys.\" Jim Murray, Whisky Magazine\n\nAWARDS\n2019 Gold Medal;

They called it White Dog. This raw distillate was clear, un-aged and had a hint of sweet corn. Later distillers discovered this spirit was perfect for aging - creating what we know today as fine Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. We're still making whiskey on the spot where ancient buffalo once crossed the Kentucky River and following centuries of time-honored distilling tradition. Enjoy this White Dog the way Americans did more than 200 years ago.",

Wild Turkey shines on its own, or in a mixed drink like a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned. That's why Eddie calls it “a whiskey that can stand up to any mixer or in any cocktail with the bold, in-your–face taste that is distinctively Wild Turkey.” We distill at a lower proof, so less water is added, resulting in a fuller and more robust bourbon flavor – just way the Russell's have been making it for over 60 years.",

    "Description": "Maker's Mark started with bread, of course. Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable – just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

This whiskey has an incredible full body, something younger bottles cannot accomplish.  It is rich and mouth coating, offering caramel and vanilla flavors to stand up to the classic rye spiciness that emerges on the mid palate.  Later, dark chocolate and peppermint notes appear.  The finish is an almost creamy flavor, leaving notes of vanilla, orange, and caramel, before hints of dark chocolate linger on the tongue.  ABV 50.",

Iodine-rich scotch from the Islay region is among the country's most characterful drams, with Laphroaig offering one of the most exceptional medicinal malts. The Laphroaig 10 Year is the company's entry-level scotch, which boasts a medium caramel color when poured into a glass. Scents of smoke, decay, salt, charcoal, leather and wet stone hit the nose, opening up to herbal ocean tones, peanut butter fudge and a sweet gumminess.\n\nThe first impression Laphroaig leaves on the palate is a playful dance between the salty and sweet. You'll note impressions of sea spray and breakfast porridge on the finish, fading to that classic smoky peat for which Islay whiskies are known.\n\nLike all Scotch whiskies, Laphroaig 10 Year is best enjoyed neat or with a little water added. It's also perfectly acceptable to drink on the rocks. Seriously, we won't judge. Feel free to experiment with cocktails like the Velvet Smoking Jacket, a perfectly smoky cocktail made with Laphroaig, Mezcal, Velvet Falernum and orange bitters. Shake with ice, strain and serve the cocktail neat with a simple lemon peel garnish.\n\nBuy Laphroaig Scotch Whisky 10 Year online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Gold Medal at the 2016 Denver International Spirit Competition,",

That means you can indulge in divine chocolatey goodness without having to head to a candy shop or the grocery store.\n\nThe best way to drink Dewar's White Label is to uncork it and let it breathe. Wait just a few minutes before you pour it into your favorite rocks glass or snifter. This allows the blend to explode with flavor, leaving you in its wake. It's not often you want to take a grenade to the face, but if it's Dewar's White Label, you'll probably let it slide. A predisposition for mischief may also call for a Dewar's on its own.

This bourbon boasts a mash bill of 56 percent yellow corn, 38 percent green rye and 6 percent unmalted barley, but the secret ingredient is the pure snowmelt that trickles down through the Rockies. After fermentation, it's distilled in a copper pot still and aged for just two or three years.\n\nWhat does Breckenridge Whiskey taste like? Think rye toast with honey, but in liquid form. Thanks to the high-rye mash bill, you're sure to notice the earthy, spicy rye, along with hints of banana and brown sugar. You'll also notice a touch of white pepper and toasted sesame. The long finish is sweet with a hint of oaky vanilla.\n\nThis is a bourbon you'll want to enjoy to the fullest, so skip most of the mixers. Sip this one neat or over ice. Or go for a classic bourbon drink like an Old Fashioned or a Mint Julep, both of which have the power to make great bourbon shine.

Founded in 1783 on the banks of the Ohio River, Evan Williams is one of the oldest distilleries in the country and the first bourbon distillery in Kentucky. Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.\n\nAs soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.\n\nAlthough purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.\n\nIf you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire. Evan Williams Black Label lets you show off your creativity behind the bar.\n\nBuy Evan Williams Black online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

Our 91.6 proof whisky starts out with a mellow yet rich sweet, malty taste ending in an explosion of spice. Distilled by the sea on the shores of the Isle of Skye in Scotland, centuries of local distilling tradition and the rugged environment are what makes our award-winning malt so exquisite. Intense and powerful, the flavour comes from the peat burned during the malting process and the rich vanilla imbued by the aging process. With a lasting smooth aftertaste, savour this spirit's sweet and spicy flavours served neat, or draw them out with a little water.\n\nSitting amongst the Inner Hebridean Scottish Isles, Skye is rugged, windswept and a place of extremes. Our whisky captures the spirit of its island home perfectly. In 1825, Hugh MacAskill of Eigg acquired the Talisker House and along with his brother built what was to become one of the world's most popular distilleries on the shore of Loch Harport. Now it is one of the oldest single malt Scotch whiskies made by the sea. Through fire, war and financial crises, this northern outpost has remained strong: producing consistently fine whiskies which, once tried, are rarely forgotten. Please drink responsibly.",

    "Description": "Delivering complexity and exceptional maturity, George Dickel Bottled in Bond Distilling Season 2008 Tennessee Whisky is reflective of Cascade Hollow Distilling Co.'s continuous commitment to honestly producing quality whisky. Aged for 11 years, this second Bottled in Bond release comes from barrels maturing since Fall 2008. This limited release whisky is bold and balanced with tantalizing notes of pecan, maple syrup and dried apple. Bottled in Bond Distilling Season 2008 is best served neat, on the rocks or with sugar, bitters and an orange twist for a classic Old Fashioned cocktail. “Bottled In Bond” is a label for American-made distilled beverages that follow a set of legal regulations originally laid out in the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897. As a reaction to widespread adulteration in American whisky, the act guaranteed a spirit's authenticity. These spirits must be aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, bottled at 100 proof and labeled with the identity of the single distillery where they were distilled, and, if different, where they were bottled. Distilled at Cascade Hollow Distillery, our Bottled in Bond Distilling Season 2008 whisky is one-of-a-kind. Please drink responsibly.",

    "Description": "Bulleit Bourbon is inspired by the whiskey that was pioneered by Augustus Bulleit over 150 years ago. Only ingredients of the very highest quality are used. The complexity of Bulleit Bourbon comes from its unique blend of rye, corn, and barley malt, along with special strains of yeast and pure Kentucky limestone-filtered water. Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas, the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. The finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light-tasting toffee flavor that lingers long after the final sip. Simply combine our bourbon whiskey with cloves, lemon juice, brown sugar and hot water for a comforting Hot Toddy.  Bulleit Bourbon is still distilled and aged in the Bulleit family tradition. High rye content gives it a bold, spicy character with a distinctively smooth, clean finish. Kentucky limestone-filtered water provides a foundation for the bourbon's character, while charred American oak barrels lend a smoky backbone. Please drink responsibly.",

Thanks to founders John and Hugh Stevenson setting up their brewery — and ultimately the Oban Distillery — in the 1790s, the once-sleepy port city of Oban became a bustling seaside resort in the West Highlands.\n\nThe distillery remained in the family for nearly a century before J. Walter Higgin purchased and renovated it. Now, more than 100 years later, the Oban Distillery remains essentially unchanged since Higgin's refurbishment. You simply won't find a more authentic Scotch whisky than Oban.\n\nOban 14 Year Single Malt is crafted with 100-percent barley to the distillery's exact specifications, which includes fermenting the malted barley in small-batch, lantern-shaped copper stills before aging the scotch in oak casks. During its rest, the whisky is shaped by the surrounding environment, which consists of warm, salty Gulf Stream air and a temperate climate. The result is a full-bodied, extremely dry scotch with notes of honey and dried figs, which lead to a soft, oaky finish.\n\nWondering how you should drink Oban 14 Year Single Malt? Enjoy it neat or on the rocks. The drink has a sweet, rich aroma with hints of citrus, pears, seaweed, ropes and sea salt with a slight peatiness. The long finish culminates with dry oak and fruit. You can also add a drop of water and swirl it around to note its oily characteristics and bring out the smoothness.\n\nBuy Oban 14 Year Single Malt online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Gold at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition",

    "Description": "Freddie Noe named this limited edition series of bourbons after his childhood nickname, given to him by his grandfather and master distiller, Booker Noe.\n\nChapter 3 edition blend comprises: nine-year-old Knob Creek and Basil Hayden's Bourbons, an 11-year-old Booker's Bourbon and a 12-year-old Baker's Bourbon.\n\n“The Road Home” batch pays tribute to my grandfather as the name Little Book is actually the childhood nickname that he gave me. And so I thought after having a couple of chapters under my belt that it would be a great time to pay honor to him and blend some of the liquids that he gave the bourbon industry. The four liquids that I chose to go into this batch of Little Book® are from the original small batch collection that my grandfather, Booker, created. The Road Home is a blend of nine year old Basil Hayden®, nine year old Knob Creek®, 11 year old Booker's® and 12 year old Baker's®, and as always with Little Book®, these liquids are at barrel strength and will be bottled at barrel strength as well. The name “The Road Home” references the road that I travel to and from on a regular basis, the same road my grandfather, Booker, traveled back when he used to work here at the distillery. I tinkered with a lot of different recipes, 57 to be exact, before finding what I was looking for – layers of vanilla, char and dried apricots with lingering oak. The final recipe I selected was 51 of the 57 I tried – a lot more trial and error than the others, but I thought if someone is going to play with the liquids that my grandfather developed, they had better produce a damned good blend. - Freddie Noe, 8th Generation Beam Family Distiller",

    "Description": "Given the name, it should come as no surprise that Hibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky is a harmonious blend of Japanese craftsmanship. Considered the paragon of Japanese whisky, Hibiki is a unique blend of several malt and grain whiskies that are meticulously added, resulting in an orchestra of aromas and flavors. \n\nHibiki is the culmination of the Japanese art of blending and expert craftsmanship, with a healthy heaping of luxury thrown in for good measure. The brand was launched in 1989 to celebrate the brand Suntory's 90th birthday, and it's become Japan's most highly awarded blended whisky of all time. More than that, Hibiki takes the honor of being among the most prestigious whiskies the world over.\n\nHibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky is both delicate and luminous with a wonderful complexity. The amber-colored liquid smells of rosemary, rose, lychee and sandalwood, paving the way for a honey-like sweetness with notes of white chocolate and candied orange peel. As for the finish, Hibiki Japanese Haromy is subtle with a hint of Japanese oak, which lingers on the palate.\n\nIt's best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a bit of water added. Japanese whisky pairs remarkably well with Japanese food, so don't be afraid to drink it with sashimi, sushi or a strong fermented fish. It also makes a wonderful cocktail, such as the Sokaiya, which consists of Hibiki, bitter Sencha green tea and ginger liqueur.\n\nBuy Hibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",

Prior to being coopered, the barrel wood is seasoned in open air, rain, wind, sun, and snow for eighteen months, softening the wood's harsh tannins. The barrels are then slowly toasted and heavily charred to further enrich the wood's desirable flavors.",

    "Description": "In the winter of 1881, Albert Bacon Blanton was born into one of the first families of bourbon history. At the age of sixteen, he started work in the Distillery as an office boy and fast became a leading pioneer in the development of bourbon. From the time he was made company president in 1921 until his retirement in 1952, his Distillery expanded from 44 to 144 buildings to become the largest Distillery of its day. During that period Colonel Blanton created his very special and limited supply of bourbon - his private reserve - handpicked and stored in what now is known as the famous Warehouse H. Although Colonel Blanton died in the spring of 1959, his legacy lives. Introduced in 1984, Blanton's namesake bourbon was the first ever Single Barrel Bourbon sold commercially. The Single Barrel Bourbon is the first of its kind.\n\nBlanton's is the Original Single Barrel Bourbon that retains its uniqueness today by virtue of world wide critical acclaim. It has been awarded international gold medals, grand gold medals, and recommendations from noted spirits writers like Paul Pacult. The individual barrel selection process is one that involves one of the most respected Master Distillers in the bourbon industry. Elmer T. Lee introduced Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon in 1984 and since that time has been enshrined in the Master Distillers' Hall of Fame. Elmer searched the honey spots of Warehouse H to personally select those barrels destined for greatness. Unlike other brands which are restricted to certain ages, Blanton's strives for a distinctive flavor profile across an array of years. The typical bourbon used is approximately eight years old, however, it is not unusual for the age to extend to ten or twelve years. From world-class bourbon to the most unique package, everything about Blanton's exudes quality, class, and excellence.\n\nREVIEWS\n\"Liquid gold.\"\n–Jim Murray's Whisky Bible\n\nTastingNotes\nA deep, satisfying nose of nutmeg and spices.

Paddy was as beloved as the whiskey he sold, in no small part because of the free rounds he'd give at every stop.  It was only fitting that this fine whiskey became known as Paddy's.\n\nAn approachable Irish whiskey comprised of a triple-distilled blend of grain, malt and pot-still, Paddy's is mild and yet crisp, with a hint of honey. Paddy's is the perfect session spirit for gathering ‘round for good times with friends. Triple-distilled from the finest barley and water from County Cork's Irish countryside, Paddy's matures for years in three types of oaken casks, acquiring its distinctively rich and golden color in dark, aromatic warehouses before being shipped directly from Ireland.\n\nTastingNotes:\n• Nose: Malty, fresh, woody. Hints of spice, honey, vanilla.\n• Taste: Light and crisp. Hints of nuts, malt, charred wood.\n• Finish: A gently fading sweetness. A lingering of mild, woody malt.",

Today, Sazerac Rye is the most awarded rye whiskey since 2005. \n\nSazerac Rye has the perfect balance of sweetness and spice; in part because of the unique recipe and rye used, and in part because of the thorough distillation process done at Buffalo Trace Distillery. \n\nTastingNotes:\n• Nose: Vanilla, Clove, Anise, Pepper \n• Taste: Candied Spices, Citrus \n• Finish: Smooth, Licorice, Smoked Pepper\n\nAwards:\n2019 Silver Medal - San Francisco World Spirits Competition\n2018 Silver Medal - New York International Spirits Competition\n2018 Silver Medal - North American Bourbon & Whiskey Competition\n2018 Gold Medal - Los Angeles International Spirits Competition\n2018 Gold Medal - San Francisco World Spirits Competition\n2018 Trophy Finalist;

It also has no grain whisky whatsoever anywhere in or even near the drink. It's barley all the way, folks.\n\nThe name Monkey Shoulder might sound funny, but it has a history in whisky making. The maltmen who used to turn the barley would take long shifts, using their dominant arm significantly while working. At the end, their shoulders would droop on one side, an ailment that became known as \"Monkey Shoulder.\" Today, nobody working at Monkey Shoulder actually has the affliction, though the barley still gets turned by hand. Working conditions are much better than they used to be. The name sounds cool and harkens back to the old whisky making days.\n\nMonkey Shoulder tastes delicious neat, with a splash of water, and on the rocks. It stands out in mixed drinks, too, given its orange and vanilla flavors with a bit of spice. Try it in a Rob Roy or a Blood and Sand to impress your palate and your friends.\n\nBuy Monkey Shoulder Blended Scotch online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.",
