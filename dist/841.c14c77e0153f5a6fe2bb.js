Most purveyors of legal moonshine have a version. So, it only follows that one of the biggest legal moonshine distilleries would too, and especially so considering it is located outside Great Smoky Mountains National Park: Ole Smoky Moonshine.\n\nThe idea is pretty simple. Take your “corn in a jar” (and Ole Smoky’s base moonshine is 80% corn), add apple juice, cinnamon and other pie spices, and there you have it. Old Smoky’s version winds up at a quite tame 70 proof afterward, comparable to some fortified wines.\n\nThe nose on this iced tea-looking liquid smacks of pie spices (cinnamon first and foremost) and apple juice, but mostly the spices. The apple comes forward on the palate to evenly share center stage, and the flavor really is like apple pie, and it’s not at all a boozy apple pie taste either. In fact, the first hint (and a hint is all it is) of booze comes only with the sweetly spiced finish. Even for a 20% ABV product, it’s amazingly non-alcoholic, due in large part to how flavorful it is.\n\n**[Midnight Moon Apple Pie Moonshine](test)** from the Midnight Moonshine selection. Moonshine and apple pie - it doesn't get more American than this. Junior Johnson's Midnight Moon Apple Pie is a mix of Midnight Moon, apple juice and a cinnamon stick. As these ingredients blend and age, they create a 70 proof spirit that tastes just like homemade apple pie. No fork necessary.\n\nMidnight Moon is inspired by Junior Johnsons legendary moonshine recipe. It's distilled from American corn to be ultra-smooth and clean tasting. And boy is it ever. So pop a jar open and pass it around, youre gonna love this high-quality moonshine.\nOne of the reasons whiskey is so popular is that there’s no single way to enjoy it. There’s the purist route — straight and neat, no mixers, no ice — but what fun is being a purist?
