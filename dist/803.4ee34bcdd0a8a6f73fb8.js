Japanese whiskies have garnered global acclaim for their meticulous craftsmanship and unique flavor profiles.\n\n[Nikka Whisky From The Barrel](test)s primarily known as a producer of blended whiskey.\n\nThe Nikka Whisky Distilling Co. can trace its roots back to 1918, when founder Masataka Taketsuru traveled to Scotland to learn the secrets of scotch whisky production. Born into a family of sake brewers, he was determined to bring the art of making a “genuine” whiskey to Japan and so struck out alone travelling halfway across the globe to learn from the people who started it all.\n\nNikka expanded their production to a second facility in Miyagikyo in 1969 to expand on the varieties of spirits that the original distillery was producing. It remains a privately owned company in Japan to this day. Using their multiple facilities in Japan they select a combination of spirits that make for the flavor profile they desire and bottle it when ready. For this specific bottling they pulled out all the stops. The source mash for these batches includes both grain and malt based formulas. They use different distillation methods. The spirits are aged in a variety of barrels, according to the company over 100 different batches that are blended to perfection and then further aged in a barrel to ensure that the spirits blend properly before being bottled. What we have here is a masterpiece of blending. Something to note is that, since this article was originally published, the Japan Spirits & Liqueur Makers Association released a set of guidelines to determine what can be labeled as “Japanese Whiskey.” Nikka has since included a notice on their website that this specific product doesn’t meet all of the requirements set forth in those guidelines. Which specific items it didn’t meet isn’t disclosed.\n\n[Yamazaki 12 Year Old Whisky](test)\n\nInspired by Scotch whisky, Suntory founder Shinjiro Torii opened Yamazaki Distillery in 1923, in a valley outside of Kyoto. He selected the location for its proximity to some of Japan’s softest waters, as well as the misty, humid environment that’s ideal for cask-aging. This single malt whisky is made with malted barley that is imported from Scotland at Yamazaki Distillery, the first and oldest malt whisky distillery in Japan. It comprises a blend of single malt whiskies that are fermented in stainless steel and wooden casks, distilled in copper pot stills from both Japan and Scotland, and cask-aged for a minimum of 12 years in different oak barrels, including American, Spanish, and Japanese mizunara oak barrels.\n\nJapanese whiskies are like a zen cherry blossom garden – elegant, peaceful, and utterly delightful. The attention to detail and artful blending make them a sought-after choice for whiskey enthusiasts seeking something extraordinary.\n\n![Japanesse](assets/posts/SippinStoriesADiveintoCanadianAndJapaneseWhiskeyVibes/Japaneese.webp)\n\n### Advice for Sippin' Good Vibes\n\nAlright, let's talk strategy for enjoying these liquid wonders.
