As a symbol of resilience in the face of the longest night, a massive bonfire would be lit on the distillery grounds. The flames would reach high into the obsidian sky, casting an amber glow on the faces of those huddled around, seeking warmth and camaraderie.\n\nTo mark this occasion, the master distiller at Lagavulin would select a special cask for a ceremonial dram.
